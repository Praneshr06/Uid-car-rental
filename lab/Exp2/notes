Aim:
    To Create a user profile page using props.

Description:
    The User Profile Page is a React component that displays a user's information such as name, email, profile picture, and bio.
The data is passed to the component using props, which makes it dynamic and reusable for different users. The page is styled with 
CSS to make it visually appealing and responsive across devices. Using props allows the same component to show multiple user profiles without rewriting code.

Coding:
import React from 'react';
import UserProfile from '../components/UserProfile';

export default function UserProfilePage() {
  return (
    <section className="intro">
      <h2>User Profile</h2>
      <UserProfile
        name="Alex Johnson"
        email="alex.johnson@example.com"
        avatarUrl={`https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/initials/svg?seed=Alex%20Johnson`}
        membershipTier="Gold"
        joinedOn="2023-04-12"
        totalRentals={18}
        location="San Francisco, CA"
      />
    </section>
  );
}
Result:
    A React User Profile Page that dynamically displays user details using props, with clean styling and reusable design.
